1) Retrieve all students and their majors
      select StudentName, Major
      from Stds;

2) List all Courses along with the number of credits
      select Coursename,Credits
      from Courses;

3) Find all students Enrolled in a specific course (e.g., 'Introduction to programming')
4) Get the list of instructors teaching a specific course (e.g., 'Introduction to programming')
5) Count the number of students enrolled in each course

	SELECT I.instructorName, COUNT(CI.CoursesID) AS CoursesCount
	FROM Instructors I
	JOIN Courses_Instructors CI ON I.InstructorID = CI.InstructorID
	GROUP BY I.instructorName;

6) List courses along with their instructor names
7) Get the number of courses taught by each instructor
8) Find students enrolled after a certain date (e.g., '2024-01-01')
9) Show each student with the total number of credits they are taking

SELECT s.StudentName, SUM(c.Credits) AS TotalCredits
FROM Students s
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.StudentId = e.StudentId
JOIN Courses c ON e.CourseId = c.CourseId
GROUP BY s.StudentName;

10) Show Courses that have more than 3 credits.
